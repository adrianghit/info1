S3902338, s3902338@student.rmit.edu.au
Romanian, currently undergoing my bachelor’s in construction management (Honours) in second year, I can speak Romanian, I own an orange cat whose name is Garfield, and I like outdoor activities like fishing etc 4x4
</p>

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
<p>My interest occurred earlier in the year when I thought doing something IT related would help increase my skills, it is unrelated to my current course, but I believe by doing it I can learn something new and use this information in future at a role I undertake. It’s a newfound interest that I decided to pursue recently.</p>

<h3>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>
<p>Not necessarily, I was on social media and noticed a user making content on their experience in IT, and how it helped them work a well-paying job and thought by taking on this course if I learn anything that could be used in future it would be helpful.</p>

<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
<p>I decided to come to RMIT in 2020 because of its well established reputation in Construction, with many programs set up for graduates it appeared to be a sensible decision, and 2 years on it has been going well, only fault is location, I only wish my classes were at the Bundoora campus but otherwise it has been good so far.</p>

<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
<p1>I expect to learn about the construction process start to finish as well as a rough understanding in other aspects, such as quantity surveying, and the build process. However, the course fails to apply any hands-on work, and I enjoy the hands on, without seeing a ‘product’ of the construction process I find myself lacking motivation at times.</p1>

<h1>Ideal job</h1>
<p>https://www.seek.com.au/job/57967319?type=standard#sol=bb18799b557e3125f2c67cd145b28f783a1917ef</p>
<p>The position attached is of a senior construction management role, with a 250,000-300,000 salary, this is something I would like to work towards but requires experience, not listed (year amount) however the salary is generous, and the role gives you freedom, in the sense that you are the ‘boss’ of the site and can do anything as long as the project ends on times </p>

<p>This job requires a proven track record as a senior project manager, however does not demand qualifications (Bachelor’s) instead being focused on experience prior, and characteristics of the right candidate</p>

<p>At the moment, my skills and qualifications are limited, as I do not have a qualification, yet I have some skills I have obtained from the course, yet still not able to enter a role immediately</p>

<p>To obtain the skills, I will complete the course, and obtain a job which will provide me insights and experience to eventually reach this ideal goal of senior PM</p>
