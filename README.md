<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
<p>My interest occurred earlier in the year when I thought doing something IT related would help increase my skills, it is unrelated to my current course, but I believe by doing it I can learn something new and use this information in future at a role I undertake. It’s a newfound interest that I decided to pursue recently.</p>

<h3>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>
<p>Not necessarily, I was on social media and noticed a user making content on their experience in IT, and how it helped them work a well-paying job and thought by taking on this course if I learn anything that could be used in future it would be helpful.</p>

<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
<p>I decided to come to RMIT in 2020 because of its well established reputation in Construction, with many programs set up for graduates it appeared to be a sensible decision, and 2 years on it has been going well, only fault is location, I only wish my classes were at the Bundoora campus but otherwise it has been good so far.</p>

<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
<p1>I expect to learn about the construction process start to finish as well as a rough understanding in other aspects, such as quantity surveying, and the build process. However, the course fails to apply any hands-on work, and I enjoy the hands on, without seeing a ‘product’ of the construction process I find myself lacking motivation at times.</p1>
