<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
<p>My interest occurred earlier in the year when I thought doing something IT related would help increase my skills, it is unrelated to my current course, but I believe by doing it I can learn something new and use this information in future at a role I undertake. It’s a newfound interest that I decided to pursue recently.</p>

<h3>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).<h3>
<p>Not necessarily, I was on social media and noticed a user making content on their experience in IT, and how it helped them work a well-paying job and thought by taking on this course if I learn anything that could be used in future it would be helpful.</p>
