<h1>Personal Information</h1>
<p>Adrian Ghitoaica
S3902338, s3902338@student.rmit.edu.au
Romanian, currently undergoing my bachelor’s in construction management (Honours) in second year, I can speak Romanian, I own an orange cat whose name is Garfield, and I like outdoor activities like fishing etc 4x4
</p>

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
<p>My interest occurred earlier in the year when I thought doing something IT related would help increase my skills, it is unrelated to my current course, but I believe by doing it I can learn something new and use this information in future at a role I undertake. It’s a newfound interest that I decided to pursue recently.</p>

<h3>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>
<p>Not necessarily, I was on social media and noticed a user making content on their experience in IT, and how it helped them work a well-paying job and thought by taking on this course if I learn anything that could be used in future it would be helpful.</p>

<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
<p>I decided to come to RMIT in 2020 because of its well established reputation in Construction, with many programs set up for graduates it appeared to be a sensible decision, and 2 years on it has been going well, only fault is location, I only wish my classes were at the Bundoora campus but otherwise it has been good so far.</p>

<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
<p1>I expect to learn about the construction process start to finish as well as a rough understanding in other aspects, such as quantity surveying, and the build process. However, the course fails to apply any hands-on work, and I enjoy the hands on, without seeing a ‘product’ of the construction process I find myself lacking motivation at times.</p1>

<h1>Ideal job</h1>
<p>https://www.seek.com.au/job/57967319?type=standard#sol=bb18799b557e3125f2c67cd145b28f783a1917ef</p>
<p>The position attached is of a senior construction management role, with a 250,000-300,000 salary, this is something I would like to work towards but requires experience, not listed (year amount) however the salary is generous, and the role gives you freedom, in the sense that you are the ‘boss’ of the site and can do anything as long as the project ends on times.</p>

<p>This job requires a proven track record as a senior project manager, however does not demand qualifications (Bachelor’s) instead being focused on experience prior, and characteristics of the right candidate.</p>

<p>At the moment, my skills and qualifications are limited, as I do not have a qualification, yet I have some skills I have obtained from the course, yet still not able to enter a role immediately.</p>

<p>To obtain the skills, I will complete the course, and obtain a job which will provide me insights and experience to eventually reach this ideal goal of senior PM.</p>

<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
<p>The results of the Myer Briggs test: Entrepreneur</p>
<p>The results of the Online Learning Styles Test: Tactile</p>
<p>The results of the Big Five Personality Test: Extraversion</p>

<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
<p>The results mean that I am a person with qualities resembling an entrepreneur, and a bit extroverted, as I am “energised by the whole world”. The learning style test states that I am a tactile learner who learns best from ‘hands on’ experience.</p>

<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
<p>Within a team environment, I may not be as effective, however, according to the results I do well independently so therefore if assigned work I will do it effectively without reaching out and relying on others.</p>

<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
<p>The results do not necessarily alter my decision making when forming a team, as individuals will group themselves with whoever they sit next to or find in a class, however in my case, the lecturer has grouped me in a group instead.</p>

<h1>Project</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This project will be a new development in the automotive industry, being both a combination of software + hardware in the form of a Bluetooth OBD2 scanner, which allows compatibility for tuning of vehicle input values, which through alteration on a computer allow for greater performance attributes in the car. As well as this, the OBD2 scanner will read and erase engine lights, and provide live data and feedback to mobile devices. However, more complicated functions will be conducted via a laptop with Bluetooth connectivity to the scanner, and the ability to alter input values by the ECU to the engine is unseen in the automotive industry.</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>There are millions of cars on the roads in Australia, and while there is an existing OBD2 reader, one with the abilities offered is not available. Therefore, the market is extremely large, and applicable to vehicle owners with a car newer than 1996 (when OBD2 ports became mandatory). The market for those looking to fine tune their vehicles for performance reasons is also large, and one which will heighten demand on the product. The product will diagnose faults on those needing a portable, reliable tool which can be kept easily in a glovebox, ready to use whenever.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The product itself is a small, Bluetooth OBD2 scanner, with a size of 57*46*24. The product, when paired to a phone or device with Bluetooth capability, is able to read trouble codes across various makes and models. This device will save the consumer hundreds of dollars from going to the mechanic and allow for a lot of DIY work, and even cater to those in the higher end of the market. The product is simple in its basic form, working to clear fault codes, however the complexity of it occurs in the development of tuning software which will work with most makes and models.</p>

<p>The product exists in the current market as a fault code clearer, but not as a live data stream and with tuning capability, this is where the product being offered upgrades the faults of the previous. The ability to be compatible with all manufacturer software will be a challenge, as each manufacturer offer a specific diagnosing tool to their company. For example, Mitsubishi offer the MUT 3 scan tool, and this can only be applied to Mitsubishi vehicles. To maximise the use of the product, multiple companies’ software must be acquired, and then compacted to fit the memory constraints found in a small device, in order to make the tool more applicable to a wider variety.</p>

<p>In continuation, the product will be produced in China to reduce costs, and software applied locally in Australia when the product arrives. The product will offer live data stream, extracting data from all sensors to deliver statistics such as coolant temperature to avoid overheating, voltage to mass airflow sensor to avoid performance issues, and even boost pressures if the car is turbocharged. Through this, the owner of the vehicle can avoid issues which may lead to the detriment of the engine, and thus save thousands of dollars. The product in turn offers a service which can save money if the car decides to ‘self detonate’ itself.</p>

<p>Therefore, through reading the sensors, the product can also read the fault codes. This is helpful if the vehicle starts acting strange, as most modern vehicles can self diagnose themselves when the ECU reads values which are not recognisable and/or not at the value needed to operate correctly. Through reading the fault codes, the owner can self diagnose the car and in turn fix it if the fault is simple enough. This ability alone can save hundreds of dollars from visits to the mechanics, especially with a code which may only come up occasionally, as the consumer can clear it themselves and refer to the mechanic with the issue and retrieve a rough quote over the phone, instead of a shock at the shop when the bill comes.</p>

<p>The software allowing for tuning capabilities is the biggest attraction, as no other product on the market offers this. The product will allow for altering of input values, such as fuel/air ratio, to affect the combustion process to achieve greater power/performance. Furthermore, the product will work well with turbocharged vehicles which run greater air/fuel pressures (as this is how the turbo acts to improve performance). The OBD2 portable scanner will also provide readings of torque to the wheels which will be read while driving, acting as a “dyno”. Through reading all performance statistics, a well-informed individual can alter these values, and save thousands from tuning from professionals, however, be advised, that this is a function for those who understand it, as tuning without the proper knowledge can lead to the premature failure of an engine.</p>

<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>The software applied will require compatibility across a universal range of cars, which requires specific downloading of applications which car dealerships use, such as the MUT 3 for Mitsubishi allowing for technical data. The hardware will be in the form of the OBD2 Scanner itself to allow for the program to work with the vehicle and in turn allow the diagnostic and tuning to occur. The software will be difficult to match to every make and model, however a menu will appear on screen to allow for selection of make, with the menu on both the phone and laptop. Therefore, there are a few components which need to be addressed before the product can enter the market.</p>

<h3>Skills required</h3>
<p>To develop the product, someone with skills in the automotive industry and with IT capabilities is required to alter and change the software to work with the vehicles. Majority of software specific to manufacturers can be accessed online, allowing for budget cutting, however the issue will be uploading the diagnostic tool to the OBD2 scanner. The hardware required will be in the form of the OBD2 part itself which will be outsourced to a Chinese supplier, with the only alteration by the seller applicable to the software being uploaded onto the scanner itself, minimising the contact between product and finished product.</p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>This product will fulfil a gap in the market between consumer and mechanic, to minimise money and time spent in the shop. The success of this project can be defined as the mainstream adoption of this product in most home environments, as a tool kept in the car to run live data, with the possibility of a single home buying multiple for all vehicles. Therefore, this solves the problem between consumer and mechanic, acting as a device for tuning capabilities and diagnostics, which widens the market demographic, as instead of a focus on diagnostics, the product shifts towards tuning capabilities.</p>
